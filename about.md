# About Me

<img src="assets/me.jpg" alt="me" style="float: right; margin: 0 0 20px 20px; width: 40%;">

I am currently a Codepoint Fellow at Sutter Hill Ventures working at a stealth startup in the Bay Area.

In college I spent most of my time solving programming and math problems for fun.

In my free time I enjoy learning new things and running... well, I don't know if I _enjoy_ running, but I certainly do it haha.
I recently completed my first marathon, **_The San Francisco Marathon_**, with a time of 3:11.
I am also learning how to play the piano, current piece: Bach's **_G Minor_**.

The most recent book I read is **_Living With a SEAL_** by Jesse Itzler (feat. David Goggins)

## some random takeaways from **_Living With a SEAL_**

### From Jesse

- Get your foot in the door, _then_ figure it out
- Be open to trying to new things
- Do something worth writing a book about

### From SEAL

- Do something uncomfortable _everyday_
- If you can see yourself doing it you can probably do it, if you can't see yourself doing it then you definitely can't do it
- You're only 40% done (body over mind)
- There's _always_ time for 100 push-ups

## some things I want to do

- [X] Run a marathon
- [ ] Try standup comedy
- [ ] Open water swim from Alcatraz to SF
- [ ] Scuba Dive
