# My Projects

## [2048 Player](https://github.com/cameroncuster/2048_player)

This project implements an AI player for the game 2048. The algorithm calculates the game state after 5-7 moves, simulating all possible moves and tile placements. It uses a heuristic function to evaluate board states and employs memoization and pruning for improved performance.

## [Snake Player](https://github.com/cameroncuster/snake_player)

A Snake game player that uses graph traversal algorithms, particularly AStar, for pathfinding. The player demonstrates emergent behaviors and performs well on various grid sizes, with or without obstacles. It frequently achieves perfect or near-perfect scores.

## [Quadtree Image Compression](https://github.com/cameroncuster/quadtree_image_compression)

This project implements image compression using a Quadtree structure. It's designed with abstraction, Test-Driven Development (TDD), and object-oriented programming principles in mind. The tool can be used for compressing images and videos, and the Quadtree implementation can be used as a standalone library.
