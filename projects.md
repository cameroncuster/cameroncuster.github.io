## [I Beat Rock](https://github.com/cameroncuster/I_beat_rock)

[@camc on the leaderboard](https://www.whatbeatsrock.com/leaderboard-all)

Developed a strategy and implemented a bot to play [What Beats Rock](https://www.whatbeatsrock.com/), overcoming unique challenges:

- **LLM Judging**: The game uses an LLM for judging, which can be inconsistent. Solution: Leveraged response caching to ensure consistency once a "battle" was judged.
- **Rate Limiting**: Set up ~20 forward proxies on GCP to distribute requests across various IP addresses, enabling longer play sessions for higher scores.

Key aspects:

- Data mining for optimal responses
- Distributed request handling
- Efficient caching mechanism
